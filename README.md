Path of Everything - all nice to haves

You need to specify some configs in the Script.

browser - set your browser as you wish! chrome.exe for Google Chrome or firefox.exe for Mozilla Firefox
tradepath - set the path to your tradeMacro folder last \ included
poepath - set the path to your Path of Exile installation - last \ included
pobpath - set the path to your Path of Building exe - last \ included

if you've done that you can start the script.
it will load Path of Exile and the TradeMacro.

after that it will give you the opportunity to use some Hotkeys.
